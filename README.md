     `  `- Finds processes which violates basic rules of windows processes
    
3 - **Injected_Code_Hunter_x64.exe/Injected_Code_Hunter_x86.exe** - hunts all the processes for code injections<br/>
     `  `- Detects and dumps injected code in live system

**NOTE:** All the above executable need to be run in **Administrator mode**. Below is the description of the exe's.


Testing ProcMemScanner_Beta.exe
=================================
ProMemScan requires two files to work: "whitelist_process.txt"  and "sign.dat". To initially test the scanner, you need to paste this string "ScannerTestX5O-TEST-Mem" into the notepad. Then run this tool in administrator mode. Notepad Process should be detected as "notepad and see if the notepad process is detected as "mal_scanner_test".
